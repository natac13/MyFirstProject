# edx MIT 6.00

Just starting and trying to figure everything out!
I am placing all my solutions to the problem sets from the edx course, MIT 6.00 
I am currently taking this course and will only be placing my solutions after the deadline for the PS

I am trying to learn to code on my own and just heard about github
Read that I should not be afraid to put my code up for inspection as this will help me improve!

I look forward to hearing input, good, or bad lol
However I will say I am not completely sure how to use github and Git yet so I hope I am doing things 'right'!
