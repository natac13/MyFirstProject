## Computer choose hand and Comp play hand

* Finish both of these with a bit of ease... However, the grader on edX gave
  me some difficulty! For some reasom I needed to re-update the hand variable,
  since when compChooseWord() was being called the original hand dict was being
  passed as the argument. Or some other difficulty, since I used print 
  statement of the compWord variable which is simply the function compChooseWord
  called. The out put seems completely fine when I run things in Powershell
  terminal. 
* I posted a questions of the forums to try and get help and if not I should 
  put this info out on github when I have 'pushed' the project up to the 
  central repository
  
* Other then that complaint I had to update the isValidWord() a bit just 
  because it did not need to check if the word was in the list of words, since
  the computer already did that step!
